### Hello 👋

<!--
**coriraquel/coriraquel** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Cori Ingram and I am a graduate of the College of William & Mary with a degree in Data Science. This is home to all of my completed coding projects throughout my undergraduate experience and during the first few months of my post-graduate life. I am interested in Data Analytics as well as exploring basic applications of UX Design skills.
